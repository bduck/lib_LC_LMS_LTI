"Hi This is the Levure based application that I started on. to open the project open the LiveCode stack app/standalone.livecode If you want to get the 'Hello world' moment, open the stack, click on the 'create requests' button and then when it switches to the create Requests card click on the 'get product versions'. The response will be in the 'Result'. Click on the 'Find project Version' button will find the latest version of the projects listed in the results window. ie. bas, lp, lti. The rest is WIP. If you search the scripts for the word 'TODO' you will find the next steps I was planning to work on. There is one issue about getting the settings card behaviour to load properly. Not sure why, the requests card behaviour works fine. See the 'create requests' button and the stack 'settings card behavior' scripts for more details in the comments. I am looking forward to it being up on github and seeing how that works. Martin"
